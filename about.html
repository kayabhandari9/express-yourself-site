        <h1>About Kaya</h1>
        <p>Hi! I’m <strong>Kaya Bhandari</strong> — a provincial public speaking champion, coach, and first-year student at <strong>Western University</strong>, studying Health Sciences with an <strong>Ivey AEO</strong> business pathway. For over six years, public speaking has been the center of my world — not just as a skill, but as my greatest passion and purpose.</p>

        <p>I’ve spent more than half a decade competing, mentoring, and coaching others to find their voice. From winning provincial titles to leading through <strong>Toastmasters International</strong>, I’ve learned that confidence isn’t something you’re born with — it’s something you build, moment by moment, speech by speech.</p>

        <p>Speaking taught me courage, resilience, and the art of connecting with people on a human level. Now, through <strong>Express Yourself</strong>, I’m sharing those lessons with the next generation — so that every young person in London, Ontario, can feel confident walking up to a microphone, standing on stage, or simply raising their hand in class.</p>

        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <p><em>To empower the next generation of speakers to express themselves with confidence, courage, and authenticity — because when you find your voice, you find your power.</em></p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>At <strong>Express Yourself</strong>, our programs are designed to help every student step into their full potential as a speaker, leader, and communicator. Whether you’re preparing for a competition, building interview confidence, or simply wanting to express yourself more freely — we meet you where you are and help you grow from there.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Competition Prep & Entry:</strong> Learn structure, storytelling, and delivery strategies to stand out — and get support with finding and enrolling in contests.</li>
          <li><strong>Confidence & Presence:</strong> Transform nerves into focus with body language, vocal control, and audience connection techniques.</li>
          <li><strong>Interview & Leadership Coaching:</strong> Build clarity, poise, and standout answers for jobs, programs, and leadership roles.</li>
          <li><strong>Stage Skills:</strong> Master pacing, emphasis, and emotional impact so your message lands and lasts.</li>
          <li><strong>Calm the Nerves:</strong> Practical tools for anxiety — breathing, reframing, and pre‑performance routines that work.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Whether you’re speaking in front of a classroom or a crowd, our mission is the same: to help you feel proud, prepared, and powerful every time you speak.</p>
